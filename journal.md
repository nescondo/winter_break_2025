# Day 1 - 12/13/25
<b>Session 1</b>: ~1pm
 
Began <b>The C++ Programming Lanugage (4th edition)</b> by Bjarne Stroustrup. Went through Chapter 1 until Chapter 2, stopping at <b>2.3.2</b> (classes).

Things to note include: type conversions, switch cases, const/constexpr, auto, range for, nullptr, structs, and some initialization syntax

Roughly 1hr and 55mins for reading and coding out some examples.

<b>Session 2</b>: 4:35pm

Finished up Chapter 2. Covered some code examples of classes and enumerations. Read over modularity, separate compilations (header files, definitions, etc.), namespaces, error handling, exceptions, invariants, and static assertions.

Roughly ~45 mins.
