# Journal

# Day 1 - 12/13/25
<b>Session 1</b>: ~1pm
 
Began <b>The C++ Programming Lanugage (4th edition)</b> by Bjarne Stroustrup. Went through Chapter 1 until Chapter 2, stopping at <b>2.3.2</b> (classes).

Things to note include: type conversions, switch cases, const/constexpr, auto, range for, nullptr, structs, and some initialization syntax

Roughly 1hr and 55mins for reading and coding out some examples.

<b>Session 2</b>: 4:35pm

Finished up Chapter 2. Covered some code examples of classes and enumerations. Read over modularity, separate compilations (header files, definitions, etc.), namespaces, error handling, exceptions, invariants, and static assertions.

Roughly ~45 mins.

<b>Session 3</b>: 7:15pm

Read through Chapter 3 and ending at <b>3.3.2</b> (Moving Containers). Covered more about classes, specifically concrete classes, abstract classes, containers, abstract types, virtual functions, class hierarchies, copy constructor and copy assignment operators.

~45 mins.

<b>Session 4</b>: 10:00pm
Finished up Chapter 3. Covered templates, interfaces and more about moving.

~30 mins.

# Day 2 - 12/14/25
<b>Session 1</b>: 9am

Finished Chapter 4, 5 (end of Tour of C++), and 6 (start of part 2 of the book). Overviewed various containers (vectors, maps), algorithms (sort), iterators, shared/unique pointers, concurrency in Chapters 4 and 5. In Chapter 6, reviewed types and declarations to include initializer lists (why they're preferred and when not to use them, ie. with auto), auto and decltype(), scope, and basic overview of basic types to including integral, arithmetic, and user-defined types.

4hrs 10min.

<b>Session 2</b>: 3:15pm

Finished Chapter 7 which went over pointers, arrays, and references. Maybe a good idea to review references, lvalues, rvalues, and even pointers to practice.

1hr 14mins.
