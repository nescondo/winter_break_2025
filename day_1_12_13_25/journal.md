# Day 1 - 12/13/25
~1pm began <b>The C++ Programming Lanugage (4th edition)</b> by Bjarne Stroustrup. Went through Chapter 1 until Chapter 2, stopping at <b>2.3.2</b> (classes).

Things to note include: type conversions, switch cases, const/constexpr, auto, range for, nullptr, structs, and some initialization syntax

Took about roughly 1hr and 55mins for reading and coding out some examples.
